PROBLEM TITLE: THE MISSIN_ CHARACT_RS

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 Given a string, find if characters of the string are contigous(lexicographical sense). If they are, then print 'YES'(no inverted commas). Otherwise print the maximum number of missing characters between (any) 2 characters.
                    
INPUT:

       For every i'th string in n strings:
       The first line takes the number of characters in the string.
       The next line takes the input string.

NOTE: The input consists of only english alphabets(no special symbols).

CONSTRAINTS:
1<=n<=10^9

OUTPUT FORMAT:
print 'YES' if the characters are contigous, print the maximum number of in-between missing characters otherwise.
