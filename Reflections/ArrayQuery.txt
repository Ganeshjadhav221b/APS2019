Segment Tree:
  - Used generally when there are non changing values.
  -It is a strict binary tree used for storing segments where each node represents a segment(interval).
  -Processing complexity: O(n)
  -Query complexity: O(logn)
  -Update complexity: O(logn)
  -Space complexity: O(4n)
  
Lookup Table:
  -For faster results, lookuptable is precomputed for set of values in local machiine.
  -Processing complexity: O(n^2)
  -Query complexity: O(1)
  -Space complexity: O(n^2)
  
Square root decomposition:
  -Query complexity: O(sqrt(n))
  -Processing complexity: O(n)
  -Space complexity: O(n)
